Welcome to ADHDevOps.club!

<!--more-->

While watching [Chloe Condon](https://twitter.com/ChloeCondon)'s keynote
at [Deserted Island DevOps 2021](https://desertedisland.club/),
I was reminded of how many folks with ADHD work in DevOps.

I actually think we're drawn to DevOps for a number of reasons,
and I'd like to explore that trend.
For now, I'm just setting up a few things to make it easy to contribute.

Stay tuned for stories and resources from folks all across the community!

With love,
