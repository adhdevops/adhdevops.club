One of the tools [Chloe Condon](https://twitter.com/ChloeCondon) suggested at
[Deserted Island DevOps 2021](https://desertedisland.club/) was Trello,
currently owned by Atlassian after they bought out the original developers.
Trello is a kanban board, and if you don't know what that is stick with me,
because I'm about to explain how it can change your life.

<!--more-->

The central thesis behind the talk, and the inspiration for this site,
was simple: using devops/agile tooling and techniques,
you can improve your life with ADHD and help make up for some of the drawbacks
the condition can bring.
A simple kanban board is one of the most obvious ways this philosophy
can be made manifest in your life.
You don't even need Trello: you can start right now, today,
using the post-it notes your house is probably littered with
and a blank bit of wall.

## Kanban 101

Allow me to explain: in the late 1940s, in auto manufacturing,
it was common to overproduce certain parts and assemble them late.
You might have one part coming out of a machine at 10/minute
and one part coming out of a machine at 1/minute,
and you need three of the former for every one of the latter...
it was a headache to keep track of, so they just kept surplus parts
and assembled them when orders came in.
The idea behind the Kanban system was eliminating waste
by streamlining manufacturing such that you only produced enough
to make exactly how many pieces you needed to fill your orders,
and you didn't start the conveyer belt until you had an order come in.
Then you could optimize your bottlenecks, like buying more of the slower machine
so that the whole line isn't backed up waiting for that part for a whole minute.

Most of that isn't relevant to ADHD, of course.
You're not trying to streamline anything; probably, if you're like me,
you feel like you're running on top of a giant ball,
trying desperately to keep from being crushed.
How can Kanban help with that?

If you're like most of us here at the ADHD DevOps Club,
you've forgotten a lot of things you meant to get done.
Like most of us, you've probably tried post-it notes,
but then you lose the post-its!
I solved this by making a kanban board out of post-it notes
on my crafts room wall.

![Example kanban board in an office setting. There are four columns: Someday, Soon, Currently, and Recently. Above the board is a quote: "If every pork chop were perfect, we wouldn't have hot dogs."](/images/kanban1.png)

A kanban board works like this:
for every step of the project or piece of work
that needs to be done to service a ticket, you create a column.
Then you make one post-it for every task that needs doing.
The simplest board has three columns: To-Do, In Progress, Done.
As soon as you think of something you need to do, drop everything,
write a post-it, and (this is crucial!) _stick it to the wall_.
It goes in the To-Do column unless you're fancy and have different columns.
Then you can go right back to what you were doing,
no need to keep some mental space free for the new task you thought of.
When you move a task to the Done column
(which you do every time you finish something),
you pick up another task from the To-Do column.

Of course, the reason my post-it wall worked for me was the location.
First of all, it was an entire wall, which meant that it was hard to lose;
similar attempts on the backs of notebooks or whiteboards
got lost over the years.
Secondly, it was in my crafts room,
meaning that if I had time to work on a craft project,
I could walk into the crafts room and immediately see where I'd left off.
That doesn't work so well for everyday life,
especially if you work from an office.
For that, you'll need something you can take on the go with you,
but can't physically lose.
For that I recommend Trello.

## Trello Review

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is the simplest,
easiest to use kanban board I've ever seen.
It's definitely my go-to suggestion for people who want to get a feel
for how to do kanban.
Since it was bought by Atlassian,
it's been fleshed out with more optional features,
but I suggest ignoring all that
unless you're used to something complicated like Jira
and want a more fully-featured experience.

![Example kanban board in Trello. The background is an obnoxious bright pink. There are four columns: Parking Lot, To Do, Today, and Done. Each has several boxes with short items like "buy new shoes" or "watch game of thrones". To the right is a menu of options.](/images/trello.png)

First of all, I should put many of your minds at ease:
the pink background is not standard, this screenshot has been customized.
You can put photos or colors as a background to your boards
to help distinguish one from another;
the pink is my way of saying this is my personal board,
as opposed to my crafting board or my professional board or my writing board.
(I have a lot of hobbies!)

A new board in Trello actually begins empty;
you are given a curser with a text box at the top of the only column,
ready to name it.
Naming the column saves it and generates another, and another,
until you have the column layout you want.
To add a "card" (or to-do item), you click the "add card" button in any column.
Out of the box there's no workflow set up;
drag and drop the cards where you want them.
You can use the software just like that, with no additional features,
and get a ton of value out of it.

![Example card in Trello. It has a title of 'Sample Card' and is in list 'Done'. There is room to add a description, as well as a menu of extra features along the side.](/images/trello2.png)

The next bit of additive functionality comes when you click on a card.
 Here you can add a description as long as you want, if there's additional details to note down.
 Making a phone call?
 Jot down notes while you're on the phone so you don't forget what was said later.
 Need to do a task that takes more than ten minutes?
 Make a note here every time you progress on it so you know where you left off.

If you collaborate with others, say, on a hobby or a work project,
you can use Trello in a collaborative mode.
Boards can be shared, and you can assign a card to someone else,
causing their picture to show up on the card in the list view.
Once you start getting into a professional setting,
you might find Atlassian's full-fledged ticketing product, Jira,
more to your liking,
especially now that they've tailored some of the Jira configurations
out of the box for non-software projects like help desks or design work.
But Trello neatly bridges the gap between personal use and professional use,
especially if your budget is $0.

And that's probably the best part of Trello: it's absolutely free.
Sure, you'll run into features here and there clicking around
that require you to upgrade;
the biggest pinch is probably the 10 board limit,
however, and that's not usually something you'll run into
unless you have a ton of hobbies.
You don't really need their fancy "butler" stuff,
their integration with other software, their "power-ups",
or their calendar view to organize your life right now.
The closer you get to having a fully fledged workplace
all using Trello coordinated,
the more you'll want to pay for the product, which is a genius strategy,
since it charges companies that have the extra budget
to pay for all of us ADHD folks who just need a replacement for post-it notes
that lives in the cloud.
Give it a shot today, it might just change your life.

Be Well,
