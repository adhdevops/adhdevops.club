Code of conduct for the ADHDevOps.club community.

## Introduction

This is a new "community" (if we can call it that)
and it's currently being "run" by a single person in their spare time.
There's a chance the whole thing could dissolve in a couple months.

In the unlikely event that the site stays up and somehow attracts readers,
it's important to ensure that this space remains safe, inclusive, and welcoming.
To that end, "we" are adopting a code of conduct.
