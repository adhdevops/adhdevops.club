## Accessibility

Accessibility is a requirement.

It's impossible to achieve perfect accessibility for every individual need,
but it's important to strive to follow best practices
so that the site is accessible to the largest audience possible.

There some great
[articles on web accessibility from WebAIM](https://webaim.org/articles/).
Here are a few recommended reads for authors:

- [image alt-text guide](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/)
- [link description guide for accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/)
- [guide to writing clearly and consistently](https://webaim.org/techniques/writing/)

These guides have great info for developers and designers:

- [introduction to semantic HTML structure](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/)
- [introduction to accessible CSS](https://webaim.org/techniques/css/)
- [guide to contrast and color accessibility](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/)
- [guide to accessible typefaces and fonts](https://webaim.org/techniques/fonts/)
- [guide to accessible text and typographical layout](https://webaim.org/techniques/textlayout/)

## Contribute content

You don't need to be able to run the site locally to contribute content,
but it does help a lot.
Please see [DEVELOPMENT.md](/DEVELOPMENT.md) for instructions.

When in doubt, open an issue!

## Contribute design/layout/etc. improvements

The site is meant to be minimal and low-maintenance,
which is why we're starting with a minimal static Hugo site.

If you have feedback or suggestions, please open an issue!

### Non-blog content

We'd love to publish content that's more timeless than a blog post!
We're also open to converting existing blog post advice into guides.

Please open an issue to describe what you'd like to see.

### Contribute a new blog post

If you would like to draft a blog post to publish on the site,
please open a PR with the content you want to contribute.

(More details coming soon.)
